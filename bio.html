        <P class="bio">I'm passionate about building things . I used different software to modify and enhance features on my computer games and once that happened, I was completely hooked to the world of computers.
  
          Since starting, I've cultivated my passion for coding by studying through free courses like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">TheOdinProject</a>, but most of all, by changing game codes, so that I could impress my friends.
          
          Lately, I've discovered my passion for the world of web development and the beauty behind building useful websites like the one you will find in this portfolio. I'm now part of a coding bootcamp where I want to enhance my skills to become a software engineer and obtain a junior dev position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.‚Äù</P></div>
