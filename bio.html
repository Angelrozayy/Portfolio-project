        <P class="bio">Hi! I'm [name], and I'm passionate about building things.

          I've always been fascinated by the world of computers, but once I started modifying the features on my games, it was like a lightbulb went offâ€”I was completely hooked. Since then, I've cultivated my passion for coding by studying through free courses like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">TheOdinProject</a>, but most of all, by changing game codes so that I could impress my friends.
          
          Recently, though, I discovered my passion for the web development world and the beauty behind building useful websites like the one you'll find in this portfolio. And now that I have an opportunity to start working as a software engineer at [company name], it's time to take it to the next level with a full-time job and an opportunity to learn among professionals!</P></div>
